  Initializing Basic Data
  Mode is:            0
  Topology is n2c, node adjacent cells
  Using Tags 
  Not using n1 Tags 
  Not using level per cell 
  - Started Setting up n1 neighs 
  - First time initializing n1 neighs 
  - Started Setting up n1 neighs with lasso 
  - Finished Setting up n1 neighs with lasso : add_more is T
  - Local n1 prelim-requests setup 
  - Local Dynamic Search: Updating N1 demands
  - Updating MPI cells whose n1 neighs are not present
  - All n1 neighs are missing from the mpi cell db
  - Finalizing updates without n1 tags
