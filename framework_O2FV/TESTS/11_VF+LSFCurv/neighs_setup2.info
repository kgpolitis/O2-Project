  Initializing Basic Data
  Mode is:            0
  Using Tags 
  Using n1 Tags 
  Using level per cell 
  - Started Setting up n1 neighs 
  - Setting up n1 neighborhoods in tagged cells and n1 tagged cells 
  - Add_more is true... 
  - missing n1 neighs required but not found 
  - n1 still not locally available -> get from neighs 
  -         5749 cells n1 neighs obtained by neighs
  - n1_globally_available =  F
  - Working with n1 tags
  - Started Setting up n1 neighs with lasso 
  - Finished Setting up n1 neighs with lasso
