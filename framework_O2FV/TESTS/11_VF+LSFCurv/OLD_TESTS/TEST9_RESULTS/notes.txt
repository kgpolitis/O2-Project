Notes and Observations about TEST CASE 9 : Using the boundary corrections 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case description:
 1. Planar interface are reconstructed systematically
 2. Each interface differs from the next by changing the normal unit vector of the plane
 3. The point defining the plane remains the same
 4. For the definition of the normal vector the following points are used ( l=grid length scale )
    > Point C=(0,-l/2,l/2)
    > Point A=(0,-1d0,hs ), hs is an array of lengths, an interface is defined for each hs
    and the unit vector ii
    > After a certain amount of iterations, when hs exceeds 1d0, point A becomes A=(0,-hs_in_inverse,1d0)
    and the procedure repeats
    > In this case we did 39 iteration till we reached 1d0 and afterwards 39 more
    The effect of the above choises is:

 5. For the boundary corrections method 9 is used!
 
 
Matlab Notes:
  % define hs
  ls=0.1/4
  hs=linspace(0,38*l,39)
  % define interface angles 
  phi=[atan2(hs,1) atan2(1,hs(end:-1:1)]*180/pi
  
 
Observations:
 1. The result are expected
 2. The maximum distance error to grid length scale is 0.16. 
 3. The normals in this case are a bit wrong... repeats with corrected normals. The error is very small but makes it more 
    difficult to arrive to sound conclusions.
