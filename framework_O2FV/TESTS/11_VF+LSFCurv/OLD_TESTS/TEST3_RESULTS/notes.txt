Notes and Observations about TEST CASE 3 for introducing the boundary corrections
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case description:
1. Interpolation corrections are based on ivar
2. Gradient is used for the interpolation and the corrections
3. PLIC is not used, ivar Ci values are derived by the subsequent isosurfaces generated
4. Npasses is 2, after that the algorithm diverges
5. The interpolation is repeated after each pass 


Observations:
1. First we checked the number of passes required to obtain better results. we found that npasses=2 is
   adequate. After that the result diverge. Note that the max error at the RE_Dist file becomes a bit higher
   at npass=2 but at the same time we L1 becomes a bit better. So we compromised to npasses=2
2. The curvature scales correctly, but unfortunately this means that it becomes higher and higher.
3. The problem with this approach is that we repeat the interpolation, so it is more time consuming. Comparing
   with the previous approaches, test1 and test2, the results are only a bit better but not better enough. So 
   repeating the interpolation seems to be a waste of time.
