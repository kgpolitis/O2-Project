Notes and Observations about TEST CASE 2 for introducing the boundary corrections
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case description:
1. Interpolation corrections are based on ivar
2. Gradient is used for the interpolation and the corrections
3. PLIC is not used, ivar Ci values are derived by the subsequent isosurfaces generated
4. Npasses is 1, after that the algorithm diverges


Observations:
1. This cases check started and a mixed "gradient use approach". First the gradient wasn't used for the
   interpolation correction. This results to a diverging algorithm similar to TEST1, so afterwards we changed
   our approach and included the gradient corrections to both interpolation and corrections. We tested the 
   number of iterations for fixing the ivar values of Ci. We found that 1 pass is enough and afterwards the algorithm
   diverges.
1. Introducing more corrections steps results to a diverging algorithm, so npasses=1
2. The curvature scales correctly, but unfortunately this means that it becomes higher and higher.
