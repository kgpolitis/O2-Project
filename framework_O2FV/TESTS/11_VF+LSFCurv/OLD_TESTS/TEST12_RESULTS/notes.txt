Notes and Observations about TEST CASE 12: Using the boundary corrections 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case description:
 0. As test case 9 but with corrected normals
 1. Planar interface are reconstructed systematically
 2. Each interface differs from the next by changing the normal unit vector of the plane
 3. The point defining the plane remains the same
 4. For the definition of the normal vector the following points are used ( l=grid length scale )
    > Point C=(0, 0, l/2)
    > Vector A=(0  ,-1d0,hs(i) ), hs is an array of lengths
    > Vector B=(1d0,   0,hs(j) ), hs is the same arrays of lenghts
    > The unit normal is given by: unit(A.x.B)
    > i,j changes for each iteration, i=1:nreps, j=1:nreps

 5. For the boundary corrections method 9 is used!
 
 
Matlab Notes:
  % cell divided into:
  sub_cell=6
  % the procedure is repeated 
  reps=sub_cell*9+sub_cell/2
  % define hs
  l=0.1/sub_cell
  hs=linspace(0,(reps-1)*l,reps)
  % define interface angles 
  phi=180*[atan2(hs,1)]/pi;
  % 2D mesh
  [p t]=meshgrid(phi,phi);
  
  % column to matrix
  for i=1:reps
  for j=1:reps
  d(j,i)=dvec((j-1)*reps+i)
  end
  end
 
Observations:
 1. The result are expected and well symmetric. At 45 degs we get an almost zero error: add it manually
 2. The maximum distance error to grid length scale is about 0.185. A safe value is 0.2
