Notes and Observations about TEST CASE 6 for introducing the boundary corrections
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case description:
1. Interpolation corrections are based on faces
2. Gradient is used for the interpolation and the corrections
3. PLIC is used
4. Npasses is 0


Observations:
1. We used 5 passes as we did in TEST5, where we used the ivar interpolation corrections.
2. The results are a bit worse but similar to TEST5.
3. The curvature is a bit smaller but stills scales upwards as the grid is refined.
