Notes and Observations about TEST CASE 4 for introducing the boundary corrections
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case description:
1. Interpolation corrections are based on faces
2. Gradient is used for the interpolation and the corrections
3. PLIC is not used, ivar Ci values are derived by the subsequent isosurfaces generated
4. Npasses is 5, after that the algorithm diverges but veeeery slowly
5. The interpolation corrections are based on the faces
6. THe interpolation is repeated after each pass


Observations:
1. We begun with interpolation corrections that didn't introduce the gradient to the the corrections
   however it seems that nothing can be improved with this approach so we changed the scheme to using
   the gradient for the corrections.
2. After many checks we found that the npass is 5 is a nice compromise between speed and accuracy
3. Note that for this type of corrections the curvature behaves a bit better, but nothing astonishing. Probably this 
   is also too slow to really help.
