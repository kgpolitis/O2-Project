Notes and Observations about TEST CASE 7 for introducing the boundary corrections
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case description:
1. Interpolation corrections are based on ivar
2. Gradient is not used for the interpolation, nor the corrections
3. PLIC is used and the defines the ivar value on a pseudocell defined by inflating the boundary face
4. Each time we introduce a gradient correction in the plic subroutine and repeat the PLIC untill convergence
5. Npasses is 0


Observations:
1. The results are a bit worse than in the previous case.
2. The curvature is a bit smaller but stills scales upwards as the grid is refined.
