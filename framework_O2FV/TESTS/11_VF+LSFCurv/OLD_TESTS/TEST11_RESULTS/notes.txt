Notes and Observations about TEST CASE 11: Using the boundary corrections 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case description:
 0. As test case 9 but with corrected normals
 1. Planar interface are reconstructed systematically
 2. Each interface differs from the next by changing the normal unit vector of the plane
 3. The point defining the plane remains the same
 4. For the definition of the normal vector the following points are used ( l=grid length scale )
    > Point C=(0,-l/2,l/2)
    > Point A=(0,-1d0+l/2,hs ), hs is an array of lengths, an interface is defined for each hs
    and the unit vector ii
    > After a certain amount of iterations, when hs exceeds 1d0, point A becomes A=(0,-hs_in_inverse,1d0-l/2)
    and the procedure repeats
    > In this case we did 95 iteration till we reached 1d0 and afterwards 95 more
    The effect of the above choises is:

 5. For the boundary corrections method 9 is used!
 
 
Matlab Notes:
  % cell divided into:
  sub_cell=10
  % the procedure is repeated 
  reps=sub_cell*9+sub_cell/2
  % define hs
  l=0.1/sub_cell
  hs=linspace(0,(reps-1)*l,reps)
  % define interface angles 
  phi=180*[atan2(hs,1-sub_cell*l/2) atan2(1-sub_cell*l/2,hs(end:-1:1))]/pi
  
 
Observations:
 1. The result are expected and well symmetric. At 45 degs we get an almost zero error: add it manually
 2. The maximum distance error to grid length scale is about 0.185. A safe value is 0.2
