Notes and Observations about TEST CASE 1 for introducing the boundary corrections
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case description:
1. Interpolation corrections are based on ivar
2. Gradient is not used for the interpolation, nor for the corrections
3. PLIC is not used, ivar Ci values are derived by a zero face gradient approach


Observations:
1. Introducing more corrections steps results to a diverging algorithm, so npasses=0
2. The curvature scales correctly, but unfortunately this means that it becomes higher and higher.
