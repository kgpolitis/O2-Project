Notes and Observations about TEST CASE 5 for introducing the boundary corrections
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Case description:
1. Interpolation corrections are based on ivar
2. Gradient is used for the interpolation and the corrections
3. PLIC is used
4. Npasses is 0


Observations:
1. We tested the algorithm several times to find the number of plic passes in order to improve the gradient calculation.
   We found that 5 plic passes are adequate, afterwards the algorithm convergences. After 10 plic passes the improvement 
   is very small and no actual improvement is observed.
2. The results show that this is the best algorithm, up to now, for improving the boundary patches.
