  Initializing Basic Data
  Mode is:            0
  Using Tags 
  Using n1 Tags 
  Using level per cell 
  - Started Setting up n1 neighs 
  - First time initializing n1 neighs 
  - Skipped Setting up n1 neighs with lasso, size(cells)=0, nothing tagged 
  - Finished Setting up n1 neighs with lasso

 Started Extending Neighborhoods
  
   Checking if more cells need to be added 
   Add_more is  F
   Gathering wonos of cells whose n1 neighborhoods are required 
   Sending/Receiving requests 
   Gathering requested n1 neighborhoods 
   Sending/Receiving requested n1 neighborhoods 
   Moving n1 neighborhoods to the database            0
   Sendind/Receiving requests for cell centers / tags_n1 
   Gathering requested cell centers 
   Sending/Receiving cell centers
